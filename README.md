# StableMatching
algorithms in stable matchings

`galeshaply_all.py <n> <seed>`
This program can be used for :
- Generating random preference list for n men n women
- Generating all possible stable matchings for this preference list
- Analyzing rotations and drawing H(M) for a given stable matching
- Plotting the whole lattice of stable matchings (work needed in plotting neatly)
